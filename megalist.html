  <h1>MegaPlaylist Maker</h1>

  <p>To practice developing using react, I created a playlist maker that allows you to compile
    songs from entire albums. There are also filters and sorting that allow you to discover new artist.

  <h3>
    Goal and Value of the Application
  </h3>
  <p>
    As someone who likes discovering new music and listening to playists but does not like taking too much time to
    curate them, this web app is a simple way to sort and filter through albums and add then quickly to populate a long
    megaplaylist.

  <h3> Usability Principles Considered</h2>
    <p>
      Since the albums are complex, busy, and colorful, so the rest of the program is kept simple with clear headings
      and buttons. To allow for easing finding of new music, a obscure filter (artist who have less than 1 million
      monthly spotify listens) and newly released (albums from 2022) filter are options to filter by.

    </p>
    <h3>Organization of Components
    </h3>

    <p>
      The program is organized into an AlbumsItem component that represents each album display and the cart component
      that is rendered inside the sidebar navigation with the control panel.

      The AlbumsItem component handles rendering each album display, with props containing all the information for
      rendering. The cart component is the playlist aggregator, and takes in a prop that is the array with the album
      name and track amount to aggregate.

      The state changes when filtering and sorting make the display mapping updated. The albums show up default sorted
      by album name alphabetically, so after the state is copied over from the data json, it is sorted.</p>
